This project focuses on creating dynamic visualizations to represent financial data. The visualizations are designed to be user-friendly and facilitate easy interpretation of complex financial information. This includes:

* Trend analysis over time for sales in different countries.
* Comparative analysis between different units sold in different countries.
* Distribution and correlation analysis.
* Interactive dashboards for real-time data exploration.
* Gross sales analysis for different products sold and the profits generated.

The goal is to provide stakeholders with a clear and actionable understanding of their financial performance.

* **Visualization 1:** Stacked Column chart showing sales made by different countries.
* **Visualization 2:** Clustered Column chart comparing profits generated by the products sold.
* **Visualization 3:** A gauge displaying the total units sold around the world.
* **Visualization 4:** A pie chart showing the gross sales generated from the products sold.
* **Visualization 5:** A filled map displaying all the countries that generated income from the products they sold.
* **Visualization 6:** A line chart showing the profits generated by different countries.

## Technologies Used

* **Power BI:** For data visualization.
* **Power Query:** For data processing.
